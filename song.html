    <p>
        There are days when it feels like the world comes crashin'
        And I've been numbin' the pain just to keep distracted
        Of all the things I would fade
        You're the one that's lasted
        So, darlin', when I'm insane, and I'm overreactin'
    </p>
    <p>
        Please go easy, my heart is heavy
        I don't mean to hurt you
        Swear that I'm tryin' to be better, but I'm not
        So if you need me to leave I would understand
        But, if not, darlin', be patient, be patient with me
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you remember that park where we both were freezin'?
        When you sat on my lap and I told you everything?
        And I was close to giving up
        And you told me I was dumb
        For thinkin' you'd walk away, if I told you everything
        No-oh-oh
    </p>
    <p>
        Please go easy, my heart is heavy
        I don't mean to hurt you
        Swear that I'm tryin' to be better, but I'm not
        So if you need me to leave I would understand
        But, if not, darlin', be patient, be patient with me
        Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
        Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
    </p>
    <p>
        Please, go easy, my heart is heavy
        I don't mean to hurt you
        Swear that I'm tryin' to be better, but I'm not 
    </p>
    <p>
        So if you need me to leave I would understand
        But, if not, darlin', be patient, be patient with me
        Oh-ooh, oh-ooh (be patient, be patient with me)
        Oh-ooh, oh-ooh (be patient, be patient with me)
    </p>
